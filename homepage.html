      <p>
        Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a system should
        be organized and designing the overall structure of that system. In the
        model of the soft ware development process, as shown in Chapter 2,
        architectural design is the first stage in the software design process.
        It is the critical link between design and requirements engineering, as
        it identifies the main structural components in a system and the
        relationships between them. The output of the architectural design
        process is an architectural model that describes how the system is
        organized as a set of commu nicating components.
      </p>

      <p>
        In agile processes, it is generally accepted that an early stage of the
        development process should be concerned with establishing an overall
        system architecture. Incremental development of architectures is not
        usually successful. While refactor ing components in response to changes
        is usually relatively easy, refactoring a sys tem architecture is likely
        to be expensive.
      </p>

      <p>
        To help you understand what I mean by system architecture, consider
        Figure 6.1. This shows an abstract model of the architecture for a
        packing robot system that shows the components that have to be
        developed. This robotic system can pack dif ferent kinds of object. It
        uses a vision component to pick out objects on a conveyor, identify the
        type of object, and select the right kind of packaging. The system then
        moves objects from the delivery conveyor to be packaged. It places
        packaged objects on another conveyor. The architectural model shows
        these components and the links between them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, there is a significant overlap between the processes of
        requirements engineering and architectural design. Ideally, a system
        specification should not include any design information. This is
        unrealistic except for very small systems. Architectural decomposition
        is usually necessary to structure and organize the spec ification.
        Therefore, as part of the requirements engineering process, you might
        pro pose an abstract system architecture where you associate groups of
        system functions or features with large-scale components or sub-systems.
        You can then use this decomposition to discuss the requirements and
        features of the system with stake holders.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can design software architectures at two levels of abstraction,
        which I call
        <i>architecture in the small and architecture in the large:</i>
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Architecture in the small is concerned with the architecture of
          individual pro grams. At this level, we are concerned with the way
          that an individual program is decomposed into components. This chapter
          is mostly concerned with pro gram architectures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Architecture in the large is concerned with the architecture of
          complex enter prise systems that include other systems, programs, and
          program compo nents. These enterprise systems are distributed over
          different computers, which may be owned and managed by different
          companies. I cover architec ture in the large in Chapters 18 and 19,
          where I discuss distributed systems architectures.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Software architecture is important because it affects the performance,
        robustness, distributability, and maintainability of a system (Bosch,
        2000). As Bosch discusses, individual components implement the
        functional system requirements. The non functional requirements depend
        on the system architecture—the way in which these components are
        organized and communicate. In many systems, non-functional requirements
        are also influenced by individual components, but there is no doubt that
        the architecture of the system is the dominant influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bass et al. (2003) discuss three advantages of explicitly designing and
        document ing software architecture:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Stakeholder communicationThe architecture is a high-level presentation
          of the sys tem that may be used as a focus for discussion by a range
          of different stakeholders.
        </li>
        <li>
          System analysis Making the system architecture explicit at an early
          stage in the system development requires some analysis. Architectural
          design decisions have a profound effect on whether or not the system
          can meet critical require ments such as performance, reliability, and
          maintainability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Large-scale reuse A model of a system architecture is a compact,
          manageable description of how a system is organized and how the
          components interoperate. The system architecture is often the same for
          systems with similar requirements and so can support large-scale
          software reuse. As I explain in Chapter 16, it may be possible to
          develop product-line architectures where the same architecture is
          reused across a range of related systems.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Hofmeister et al. (2000) propose that a software architecture can serve
        firstly as a design plan for the negotiation of system requirements, and
        secondly as a means of structuring discussions with clients, developers,
        and managers. They also suggest that it is an essential tool for
        complexity management. It hides details and allows the designers to
        focus on the key system abstractions.
      </p>

      <p>
        System architectures are often modeled using simple block diagrams, as
        in Figure 6.1. Each box in the diagram represents a component. Boxes
        within boxes indicate that the component has been decomposed to
        sub-components. Arrows mean that data and or con trol signals are passed
        from component to component in the direction of the arrows. You can see
        many examples of this type of architectural model in Booch’s software
        architec ture catalog (Booch, 2009).
      </p>

      <p>
        Block diagrams present a high-level picture of the system structure,
        which people from different disciplines, who are involved in the system
        development process, can readily understand. However, in spite of their
        widespread use, Bass et al. (2003) dis like informal block diagrams for
        describing an architecture. They claim that these informal diagrams are
        poor architectural representations, as they show neither the type of the
        relationships among system components nor the components’ externally
        visible properties.
      </p>

      <p>
        The apparent contradictions between practice and architectural theory
        arise because there are two ways in which an architectural model of a
        program is used:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          As a way of facilitating discussion about the system design A
          high-level architectural view of a system is useful for communication
          with system stake holders and project planning because it is not
          cluttered with detail. Stake holders can relate to it and understand
          an abstract view of the system. They can then discuss the system as a
          whole without being confused by detail. The architectural model
          identifies the key components that are to be developed so managers can
          start assigning people to plan the development of these systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a way of documenting an architecture that has been designed The aim
          here is to produce a complete system model that shows the different
          components in a system, their interfaces, and their connections. The
          argument for this is that such a detailed architectural description
          makes it easier to understand and evolve the system.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Block diagrams are an appropriate way of describing the system
        architecture dur ing the design process, as they are a good way of
        supporting communications between the people involved in the process. In
        many projects, these are often the only architectural documentation that
        exists. However, if the architecture of a system is to be thoroughly
        documented then it is better to use a notation with well-defined
        semantics for architectural description. However, as I discuss in
        Section 6.2, some people think that detailed documentation is neither
        useful, nor really worth the cost of its development
