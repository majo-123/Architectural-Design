        <h1>ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN</h1>
        <p>
          Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a system
          should be organized and designing the overall structure of that
          system. It is the critical link between design and requirements
          engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a
          system and the relationships between them. The output of the
          architectural design process is an architectural model that describes
          how the system is organized as a set of commu nicating components.

            In agile processes, it is generally accepted that an early stage of
            the development process should be concerned with establishing an
            overall system architecture.

            Incremental development of architectures is not usually successful.
            While refactoring components in response to changes is usually
            relatively easy, refactoring a sys tem architecture is likely to be
            expensive.

            Architectural decomposition is usually necessary to structure and
            organize the specification. You can then use this decomposition to
            discuss the requirements and features of the system with stake
            holders.

            The system then moves objects from the delivery conveyor to be
            packaged. It places packaged objects on another conveyor. The
            architectural model shows these components and the links between
            them.

          You can design software architectures at two levels of abstraction,
          which I call architecture in the small and architecture in the large

        <div>

            Architecture in the small is concerned with the architecture of
            individual programs. At this level, we are concerned with the way
            that an individual program is decomposed into components. This
            chapter is mostly concerned with program architectures.
          </div>
          <div>
            Architecture in the large is concerned with the architecture of
            complex enterprise systems that include other systems, programs, and
            components. These systems are distributed across different computers
            and organizations.

          <h3>Why Software Architecture Matters</h3>
          <p>
            Software architecture is important because it affects the
            performance, robustness, distributability, and maintainability of a
            system (Bosch, 2000). As Bosch discusses, individual components
            implement the functional system requirements. The non functional
            requirements depend on the system architecture—the way in which
            these components are organized and communicate. In many systems,
            non-functional requirements are also influenced by individual
            components, but there is no doubt that the architecture of the
            system is the dominant influence.

              Hofmeister et al. (2000) propose that a software architecture can
              serve firstly as a design plan for the negotiation of system
              requirements, and secondly as a means of structuring discussions
              with clients, developers, and managers. They also suggest that it
              is an essential tool for complexity management. It hides details
              and allows the designers to focus on the key system abstractions.

              System architectures are often modeled using simple block
              diagrams, as in Figure 6.1. Each box in the diagram represents a
              component. Boxes within boxes indicate that the component has been
              decomposed to sub-components. Arrows mean that data and or control
              signals are passed from component to component in the direction of
              the arrows. You can see many examples of this type of
              architectural model in Booch’s software architecture catalog
              (Booch, 2009).

              Block diagrams present a high-level picture of the system
              structure, which people from different disciplines, who are
              involved in the system development process, can readily
              understand. However, in spite of their widespread use, Bass et al.
              (2003) dis like informal block diagrams for describing an
              architecture. They claim that these informal diagrams are poor
              architectural representations, as they show neither the type of
              the relationships among system components nor the components’
              externally visible properties.

              Block diagrams are an appropriate way of describing the system
              architecture dur ing the design process, as they are a good way of
              supporting communications between the people involved in the
              process. In many projects, these are often the only architectural
              documentation that exists. However, if the architecture of a
              system is to be thoroughly documented then it is better to use a
              notation with well-defined semantics for architectural
              description. However, as I discuss in Section 6.2, some people
              think that detailed documentation is neither useful, nor really
              worth the cost of its development

              As a way of facilitating discussion about the system design A
              high-level architectural view of a system is useful for
              communication with system stake holders and project planning
              because it is not cluttered with detail. Stake holders can relate
              to it and understand an abstract view of the system. They can then
              discuss the system as a whole without being confused by detail.
              The architectural model identifies the key components that are to
              be developed so managers can start assigning people to plan the
              development of these systems.

              architectural description makes it easier to understand and evolve
              the system.
