        <p>
          The objective of this chapter is to introduce the concepts of software
          architecture and architectural design. When you have read the chapter,
          you will.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            understand why the architectural design of software is important;
          </li>
          <li>
            understand the decisions that have to be made about the system
            architecture during the architectural design process;
          </li>
          <li>
            have been introduced to the idea of architectural patterns,
            well-tried ways of organizing system architectures, which can reused
            in system designs;
          </li>
          <li>
            know the architectural patterns that are often used in different
            types of application system, including transaction processing
            systems and language processing systems.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a system
          should be organized and designing the overall structure of that
          system. In the model of the soft ware development process, as shown in
          Chapter 2, architectural design is the first stage in the software
          design process. It is the critical link between design and
          requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural
          components in a system and the relationships between them. The output
          of the architectural design process is an architectural model that
          describes how the system is organized as a set of commu nicating
          components.
        </p>

        <p>
          In agile processes, it is generally accepted that an early stage of
          the development process should be concerned with establishing an
          overall system architecture. Incremental development of architectures
          is not usually successful. While refactor ing components in response
          to changes is usually relatively easy, refactoring a sys tem
          architecture is likely to be expensive.
        </p>

        <p>
          To help you understand what I mean by system architecture, consider
          Figure 6.1. This shows an abstract model of the architecture for a
          packing robot system that shows the components that have to be
          developed. This robotic system can pack dif ferent kinds of object. It
          uses a vision component to pick out objects on a conveyor, identify
          the type of object, and select the right kind of packaging. The system
          then moves objects from the delivery conveyor to be packaged. It
          places packaged objects on another conveyor. The architectural model
          shows these components and the links between them.
        </p>

        <p>
          In practice, there is a significant overlap between the processes of
          requirements engineering and architectural design. Ideally, a system
          specification should not include any design information. This is
          unrealistic except for very small systems. Architectural decomposition
          is usually necessary to structure and organize the spec ification.
          Therefore, as part of the requirements engineering process, you might
          pro pose an abstract system architecture where you associate groups of
          system functions or features with large-scale components or
          sub-systems. You can then use this decomposition to discuss the
          requirements and features of the system with stake holders.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can design software architectures at two levels of abstraction,
          which I call
          <i class="font-primary-color"
            >architecture in the small and architecture in the large:</i
          >
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Architecture in the small is concerned with the architecture of
            individual pro grams. At this level, we are concerned with the way
            that an individual program is decomposed into components. This
            chapter is mostly concerned with pro gram architectures.
          </li>
          <li>
            Architecture in the large is concerned with the architecture of
            complex enter prise systems that include other systems, programs,
            and program compo nents. These enterprise systems are distributed
            over different computers, which may be owned and managed by
            different companies. I cover architec ture in the large in Chapters
            18 and 19, where I discuss distributed systems architectures.

          Software architecture is important because it affects the performance,
          robustness, distributability, and maintainability of a system (Bosch,
          2000). As Bosch discusses, individual components implement the
          functional system requirements. The non functional requirements depend
          on the system architecture—the way in which these components are
          organized and communicate. In many systems, non-functional
          requirements are also influenced by individual components, but there
          is no doubt that the architecture of the system is the dominant
          influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bass et al. (2003) discuss three advantages of explicitly designing
          and document ing software architecture:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Stakeholder communicationThe architecture is a high-level
            presentation of the sys tem that may be used as a focus for
            discussion by a range of different stakeholders.
          </li>
          <li>
            System analysis Making the system architecture explicit at an early
            stage in the system development requires some analysis.
            Architectural design decisions have a profound effect on whether or
            not the system can meet critical require ments such as performance,
            reliability, and maintainability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Large-scale reuse A model of a system architecture is a compact,
            manageable description of how a system is organized and how the
            components interoperate. The system architecture is often the same
            for systems with similar requirements and so can support large-scale
            software reuse. As I explain in Chapter 16, it may be possible to
            develop product-line architectures where the same architecture is
            reused across a range of related systems.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Hofmeister et al. (2000) propose that a software architecture can
          serve firstly as a design plan for the negotiation of system
          requirements, and secondly as a means of structuring discussions with
          clients, developers, and managers. They also suggest that it is an
          essential tool for complexity management. It hides details and allows
          the designers to focus on the key system abstractions.
        </p>

        <p>
          System architectures are often modeled using simple block diagrams, as
          in Figure 6.1. Each box in the diagram represents a component. Boxes
          within boxes indicate that the component has been decomposed to
          sub-components. Arrows mean that data and or con trol signals are
          passed from component to component in the direction of the arrows. You
          can see many examples of this type of architectural model in Booch’s
          software architec ture catalog (Booch, 2009).
        </p>

        <p>
          Block diagrams present a high-level picture of the system structure,
          which people from different disciplines, who are involved in the
          system development process, can readily understand. However, in spite
          of their widespread use, Bass et al. (2003) dis like informal block
          diagrams for describing an architecture. They claim that these
          informal diagrams are poor architectural representations, as they show
          neither the type of the relationships among system components nor the
          components’ externally visible properties.
        </p>

        <p>
          The apparent contradictions between practice and architectural theory
          arise because there are two ways in which an architectural model of a
          program is used:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            As a way of facilitating discussion about the system design A
            high-level architectural view of a system is useful for
            communication with system stake holders and project planning because
            it is not cluttered with detail. Stake holders can relate to it and
            understand an abstract view of the system. They can then discuss the
            system as a whole without being confused by detail. The
            architectural model identifies the key components that are to be
            developed so managers can start assigning people to plan the
            development of these systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a way of documenting an architecture that has been designed The
            aim here is to produce a complete system model that shows the
            different components in a system, their interfaces, and their
            connections. The argument for this is that such a detailed
            architectural description makes it easier to understand and evolve
            the system.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Block diagrams are an appropriate way of describing the system
          architecture dur ing the design process, as they are a good way of
          supporting communications between the people involved in the process.
          In many projects, these are often the only architectural documentation
          that exists. However, if the architecture of a system is to be
          thoroughly documented then it is better to use a notation with
          well-defined semantics for architectural description. However, as I
          discuss in Section 6.2, some people think that detailed documentation
          is neither useful, nor really worth the cost of its development
