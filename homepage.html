            <li>understand the decisions that have to be made about the system architecture during the architectural
                design process;</li>
            <li>have been introduced to the idea of architectural patterns, well-tried ways of organizing system
                architectures, which can reused in system designs;</li>
            <li>know the architectural patterns that are often used in different types of application system, including

        <p> Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a system should be
            organized and designing the overall structure of that system. In the model of the soft
            ware development process, as shown in Chapter 2, architectural design is the first
            stage in the software design process. It is the critical link between design and
            requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a system
            and the relationships between them. The output of the architectural design process is
            an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of commu
            nicating components.</p>

        <p> In agile processes, it is generally accepted that an early stage of the development
            process should be concerned with establishing an overall system architecture.
            Incremental development of architectures is not usually successful. While refactor
            ing components in response to changes is usually relatively easy, refactoring a sys
            tem architecture is likely to be expensive.</p>

        <p> To help you understand what I mean by system architecture, consider Figure 6.1.
            This shows an abstract model of the architecture for a packing robot system that
            shows the components that have to be developed. This robotic system can pack dif
            ferent kinds of object. It uses a vision component to pick out objects on a conveyor,
            identify the type of object, and select the right kind of packaging. The system then
            moves objects from the delivery conveyor to be packaged. It places packaged objects
            on another conveyor. The architectural model shows these components and the links
            between them.</p>

        <p> In practice, there is a significant overlap between the processes of requirements
            engineering and architectural design. Ideally, a system specification should not
            include any design information. This is unrealistic except for very small systems.
            Architectural decomposition is usually necessary to structure and organize the spec
            ification. Therefore, as part of the requirements engineering process, you might pro
            pose an abstract system architecture where you associate groups of system functions
            or features with large-scale components or sub-systems. You can then use this
            decomposition to discuss the requirements and features of the system with stake
            holders.</p>

        <p>You can design software architectures at two levels of abstraction, which I call
            <i>architecture in the small and architecture in the large:</i>
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Architecture in the small is concerned with the architecture of individual pro
                grams. At this level, we are concerned with the way that an individual program
                is decomposed into components. This chapter is mostly concerned with pro
                gram architectures.</li>
            <li>Architecture in the large is concerned with the architecture of complex enter
                prise systems that include other systems, programs, and program compo
                nents. These enterprise systems are distributed over different computers,
                which may be owned and managed by different companies. I cover architec
                ture in the large in Chapters 18 and 19, where I discuss distributed systems
                architectures.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Figure 6.1</h1>

        <p> Software architecture is important because it affects the performance, robustness,
            distributability, and maintainability of a system (Bosch, 2000). As Bosch discusses,
            individual components implement the functional system requirements. The non
            functional requirements depend on the system architecture—the way in which these
            components are organized and communicate. In many systems, non-functional
            requirements are also influenced by individual components, but there is no doubt
            that the architecture of the system is the dominant influence.</p>
        <p>Bass et al. (2003) discuss three advantages of explicitly designing and document
            ing software architecture:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Stakeholder communicationThe architecture is a high-level presentation of the sys
                tem that may be used as a focus for discussion by a range of different stakeholders.</li>
            <li>System analysis Making the system architecture explicit at an early stage in the
                system development requires some analysis. Architectural design decisions
                have a profound effect on whether or not the system can meet critical require
                ments such as performance, reliability, and maintainability.</li>
            <li>Large-scale reuse A model of a system architecture is a compact, manageable
                description of how a system is organized and how the components interoperate.
                The system architecture is often the same for systems with similar requirements
                and so can support large-scale software reuse. As I explain in Chapter 16, it may
                be possible to develop product-line architectures where the same architecture is
                reused across a range of related systems.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Hofmeister et al. (2000) propose that a software architecture can serve firstly as a
            design plan for the negotiation of system requirements, and secondly as a means of
            structuring discussions with clients, developers, and managers. They also suggest
            that it is an essential tool for complexity management. It hides details and allows the
            designers to focus on the key system abstractions.</p>

        <p>System architectures are often modeled using simple block diagrams, as in Figure 6.1.
            Each box in the diagram represents a component. Boxes within boxes indicate that the
            component has been decomposed to sub-components. Arrows mean that data and or con
            trol signals are passed from component to component in the direction of the arrows. You
            can see many examples of this type of architectural model in Booch’s software architec
            ture catalog (Booch, 2009).</p>

        <p> Block diagrams present a high-level picture of the system structure, which people
            from different disciplines, who are involved in the system development process, can
            readily understand. However, in spite of their widespread use, Bass et al. (2003) dis
            like informal block diagrams for describing an architecture. They claim that these
            informal diagrams are poor architectural representations, as they show neither the
            type of the relationships among system components nor the components’ externally
            visible properties.</p>

        <p> The apparent contradictions between practice and architectural theory arise
            because there are two ways in which an architectural model of a program is used:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>As a way of facilitating discussion about the system design A high-level
                architectural view of a system is useful for communication with system stake
                holders and project planning because it is not cluttered with detail. Stake
                holders can relate to it and understand an abstract view of the system. They
                can then discuss the system as a whole without being confused by detail. The
                architectural model identifies the key components that are to be developed
                so managers can start assigning people to plan the development of these
                systems.</li>
            <li>As a way of documenting an architecture that has been designed The aim here
                is to produce a complete system model that shows the different components in
                a system, their interfaces, and their connections. The argument for this is that
                such a detailed architectural description makes it easier to understand and evolve
                the system.</li>
        </ol>

        <p> Block diagrams are an appropriate way of describing the system architecture dur
            ing the design process, as they are a good way of supporting communications
            between the people involved in the process. In many projects, these are often the
            only architectural documentation that exists. However, if the architecture of a system
            is to be thoroughly documented then it is better to use a notation with well-defined
            semantics for architectural description. However, as I discuss in Section 6.2, some
            people think that detailed documentation is neither useful, nor really worth the cost
            of its development</p>
