    <h1>6.2 Architectural views</h1>
    In this section, I discuss two issues that are relevant to both of these:

    <p>
      1. What views or perspectives are useful when designing and documenting a
      systems architecture?
    </p>
    <p>2. What notations should be used for describing architectural models?</p>

    <href
      >It is impossible to represent all relevant information about a systems
      architecture in a single architectural model, as each model only shows one
      view or perspective of the system. It might show how a system is
      decomposed into modules, how the run-time processes interact, or the
      different ways in which system components are distributed across a
      network</href
    >

    <href
      >There are different opinions as to what views are required. Krutchen
      (1995), in his well-known 4+1 view model of software architecture,
      suggests that there should be four fundamental architectural views, which
      are related using use cases or scenarios</href
    >

    <h2>The views that he suggests are:</h2>
    <p>
      1. A logical view, which shows the key abstractions in the system as
      objects or object classes
    </p>
    <p>
      2. A process view, which shows how, at run-time, the system is composed of
      interacting processes
    </p>
    <p>
      3. A development view, which shows how the software is decomposed for
      development, that is, it shows the breakdown of the software into
      components that are implemented by a single developer or development team
    </p>
    <p>
      4. A physical view, which shows the system hardware and how software
      components are distributed across the processors in the system.

        Hofmeister et al. (2000) suggest the use of similar views but add to
        this the notion of a conceptual view. This view is an abstract view of
        the system that can be the basis for decomposing high-level requirements
        into more detailed specifications, help engineers make decisions about
        components that can be reused, and represent a product line (discussed
        in Chapter 16) rather than a single system
      </h2>
      <h2>
        In practice, conceptual views are almost always developed during the
        design process and are used to support architectural decision making.
        They are a way of communicating the essence of a system to different
        stakeholders. During the design process, some of the other views may
        also be developed when different aspects of the system are discussed,
        but there is no need for a complete description from all perspectives
      </h2>
      <h2>
        A survey in 2006 (Lange et al., 2006) showed that, when the UML was
        used, it was mostly applied in a loose and informal way. The authors of
        that paper argued that this was a bad thing. I disagree with this view
      </h2>
      <h2>
        The UML is of most value when you are documenting an architecture in
        detail or using model-driven development, as discussed in Chapter 5
      </h2>
      <h2>
        A number of researchers have proposed the use of more specialized
        architectural description languages (ADLs) (Bass et al., 2003) to
        describe system architectures.
      </h2>

      <p>
        This makes it difficult to assess their usefulness for practical
        software engineering. ADLs designed for a particular domain (e.g.,
        automobile systems) may be used as a

        basis for model-driven development. However, I believe that informal
        models and notations, such as the UML, will remain the most commonly
        used ways of documenting system architectures
      </p>
      <p>
        Users of agile methods claim that detailed design documentation is
        mostly unused. It is, therefore, a waste of time and money to develop
        it. I largely agree with this view and I think that, for most systems,
        it is not worth developing a detailed architectural description from
        these four perspectives. You should develop the views that are useful
        for communication and not worry about whether or not your architectural
        documentation is complete. However, an exception to this is when you are
        developing critical systems, when you need to make a detailed
        dependability analysis of the system. You may need to convince external
        regulators that your system conforms to their regulations and so
        complete architectural documentation may be required.
