        <h1>Architectural Design Decisions</h1>
        <h2>By: Ronmel Andaya</h2>
        <p>
          Architectural design is a creative process where you design a system
          organization that will satisfy the functional and non-functional
          requirements of a system. Because it is a creative process, the
          activities within the process depend on the type of system being
          developed, the background and experience of the system architect, and
          the specific requirements for the system. It is therefore useful to
          think of architectural design as a series of decisions to be made
          rather than a sequence of activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the architectural design process, system architects have to
          make a number of structural decisions that profoundly affect the
          system and its development process. Based on their knowledge and
          experience, they have to consider the follow ing fundamental questions
          about the system:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Is there a generic application architecture that can act as a
            template for the sys tem that is being designed?
          </li>
          <li>
            How will the system be distributed across a number of cores or
            processors?
          </li>
          <li>What architectural patterns or styles might be used?</li>
          <li>
            What will be the fundamental approach used to structure the system?
          </li>
          <li>
            How will the structural components in the system be decomposed into
            sub components?
          </li>
          <li>
            What strategy will be used to control the operation of the
            components in the system?
          </li>
          <li>
            What architectural organization is best for delivering the
            non-functional require ments of the system?
          </li>
          <li>How will the architectural design be evaluated?</li>
          <li>How should the architecture of the system be documented?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Although each software system is unique, systems in the same
          application domain often have similar architectures that reflect the
          fundamental concepts of the domain. For example, application product
          lines are applications that are built around a core architecture with
          variants that satisfy specific customer requirements. When designing a
          system architecture, you have to decide what your system and broader
          application classes have in common, and decide how much knowledge from
          these application architectures you can reuse. I discuss generic
          application architectures in Section 6.4 and application product lines
          in Chapter 16.
        </p>

        <p>
          For embedded systems and systems designed for personal computers,
          there is usually only a single processor and you will not have to
          design a distributed architec ture for the system. However, most large
          systems are now distributed systems in which the system software is
          distributed across many different computers. The choice of
          distribution architecture is a key decision that affects the
          performance and reliability of the system. This is a major topic in
          its own right and I cover it sepa rately in Chapter 18.
        </p>

        <p>
          The architecture of a software system may be based on a particular
          architectural pattern or style. An architectural pattern is a
          description of a system organization (Garlan and Shaw, 1993), such as
          a client–server organization or a layered architecture. Architectural
          patterns capture the essence of an architecture that has been used in
          dif ferent software systems. You should be aware of common patterns,
          where they can be used, and their strengths and weaknesses when making
          decisions about the architec ture of a system. I discuss a number of
          frequently used patterns in Section 6.3.
        </p>

        <p>
          Garlan and Shaw’s notion of an architectural style (style and pattern
          have come to mean the same thing) covers questions 4 to 6 in the
          previous list. You have to choose the most appropriate structure, such
          as client–server or layered structuring, that will enable you to meet
          the system requirements. To decompose structural system units, you
          decide on the strategy for decomposing components into sub-components.
          The approaches that you can use allow different types of architecture
          to be implemented. Finally, in the control modeling process, you make
          decisions about how the execu tion of components is controlled. You
          develop a general model of the control rela tionships between the
          various parts of the system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because of the close relationship between non-functional requirements
          and soft ware architecture, the particular architectural style and
          structure that you choose for a system should depend on the
          non-functional system requirements
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Performance If performance is a critical requirement, the
            architecture should be designed to localize critical operations
            within a small number of com ponents, with these components all
            deployed on the same computer rather than distributed across the
            network. This may mean using a few relatively large com ponents
            rather than small, fine-grain components, which reduces the number
            of component communications. You may also consider run-time system
            organiza tions that allow the system to be replicated and executed
            on different processors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Security If security is a critical requirement, a layered structure
            for the architec ture should be used, with the most critical assets
            protected in the innermost lay ers, with a high level of security
            validation applied to these layers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Safety If safety is a critical requirement, the architecture should
            be designed so that safety-related operations are all located in
            either a single component or in a small number of components. This
            reduces the costs and problems of safety val idation and makes it
            possible to provide related protection systems that can safely shut
            down the system in the event of failure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Availability If availability is a critical requirement, the
            architecture should be designed to include redundant components so
            that it is possible to replace and update components without
            stopping the system. I describe two fault-tolerant system
            architectures for high-availability systems in Chapter 13.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintainability If maintainability is a critical requirement, the
            system architec ture should be designed using fine-grain,
            self-contained components that may readily be changed. Producers of
            data should be separated from consumers and shared data structures
            should be avoided
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Obviously there is potential conflict between some of these
          architectures. For example, using large components improves
          performance and using small, fine-grain components improves
          maintainability. If both performance and maintainability are important
          system requirements, then some compromise must be found. This can
          sometimes be achieved by using different architectural patterns or
          styles for different parts of the system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Evaluating an architectural design is difficult because the true test
          of an architec ture is how well the system meets its functional and
          non-functional requirements when it is in use. However, you can do
          some evaluation by comparing your design against reference
          architectures or generic architectural patterns. Bosch’s (2000)
          description of the non-functional characteristics of architectural
          patterns can also be used to help with architectural evaluation.
