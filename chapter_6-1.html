        <h1>Chapter 6.1: Architectural design decisions</h1>
        <p>Architectural design is a creative process where you design a system organization
            that will satisfy the functional and non-functional requirements of a system. Because
            it is a creative process, the activities within the process depend on the type of system
            being developed, the background and experience of the system architect, and the
            specific requirements for the system. It is therefore useful to think of architectural
            design as a series of decisions to be made rather than a sequence of activities.</p>
        <p>During the architectural design process, system architects have to make a number
            of structural decisions that profoundly affect the system and its development
            process. Based on their knowledge and experience, they have to consider the follow
            ing fundamental questions about the system:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Is there a generic application architecture that can act as a template for the sys
                tem that is being designed?</li>
            <li>How will the system be distributed across a number of cores or processors?</li>
            <li>What architectural patterns or styles might be used?</li>
            <li>What will be the fundamental approach used to structure the system?</li>
            <li>How will the structural components in the system be decomposed into sub
                components?</li>
            <li>What strategy will be used to control the operation of the components in the system?</li>
            <li>What architectural organization is best for delivering the non-functional require
                ments of the system?</li>
            <li>How will the architectural design be evaluated?</li>
            <li>How should the architecture of the system be documented?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Although each software system is unique, systems in the same application
            domain often have similar architectures that reflect the fundamental concepts of the
            domain. For example, application product lines are applications that are built around
            a core architecture with variants that satisfy specific customer requirements. When
            designing a system architecture, you have to decide what your system and broader
            application classes have in common, and decide how much knowledge from these
            application architectures you can reuse. I discuss generic application architectures in
            Section 6.4 and application product lines in Chapter 16.</p>

        <p> For embedded systems and systems designed for personal computers, there is
            usually only a single processor and you will not have to design a distributed architec
            ture for the system. However, most large systems are now distributed systems in
            which the system software is distributed across many different computers. The
            choice of distribution architecture is a key decision that affects the performance and
            reliability of the system. This is a major topic in its own right and I cover it sepa
            rately in Chapter 18.</p>

        <p> The architecture of a software system may be based on a particular architectural
            pattern or style. An architectural pattern is a description of a system organization
            (Garlan and Shaw, 1993), such as a client–server organization or a layered architecture.
            Architectural patterns capture the essence of an architecture that has been used in dif
            ferent software systems. You should be aware of common patterns, where they can be
            used, and their strengths and weaknesses when making decisions about the architec
            ture of a system. I discuss a number of frequently used patterns in Section 6.3.</p>

        <p> Garlan and Shaw’s notion of an architectural style (style and pattern have come to
            mean the same thing) covers questions 4 to 6 in the previous list. You have to choose
            the most appropriate structure, such as client–server or layered structuring, that will
            enable you to meet the system requirements. To decompose structural system units,
            you decide on the strategy for decomposing components into sub-components. The
            approaches that you can use allow different types of architecture to be implemented.
            Finally, in the control modeling process, you make decisions about how the execu
            tion of components is controlled. You develop a general model of the control rela
            tionships between the various parts of the system.</p>

        <p> Because of the close relationship between non-functional requirements and soft
            ware architecture, the particular architectural style and structure that you choose for
            a system should depend on the non-functional system requirements</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Performance If performance is a critical requirement, the architecture should
                be designed to localize critical operations within a small number of com
                ponents, with these components all deployed on the same computer rather than
                distributed across the network. This may mean using a few relatively large com
                ponents rather than small, fine-grain components, which reduces the number of
                component communications. You may also consider run-time system organiza
                tions that allow the system to be replicated and executed on different processors.</li>
            <li>Security If security is a critical requirement, a layered structure for the architec
                ture should be used, with the most critical assets protected in the innermost lay
                ers, with a high level of security validation applied to these layers.</li>
            <li>Safety If safety is a critical requirement, the architecture should be designed so
                that safety-related operations are all located in either a single component or in a
                small number of components. This reduces the costs and problems of safety val
                idation and makes it possible to provide related protection systems that can
                safely shut down the system in the event of failure.</li>
            <li>Availability If availability is a critical requirement, the architecture should be
                designed to include redundant components so that it is possible to replace and
                update components without stopping the system. I describe two fault-tolerant
                system architectures for high-availability systems in Chapter 13.</li>
            <li>Maintainability If maintainability is a critical requirement, the system architec
                ture should be designed using fine-grain, self-contained components that may readily be changed.
                Producers of data should be separated from consumers and
                shared data structures should be avoided</li>
        </ol>

        <p> Obviously there is potential conflict between some of these architectures. For
            example, using large components improves performance and using small, fine-grain
            components improves maintainability. If both performance and maintainability are
            important system requirements, then some compromise must be found. This can
            sometimes be achieved by using different architectural patterns or styles for different
            parts of the system.</p>

        <p> Evaluating an architectural design is difficult because the true test of an architec
            ture is how well the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements
            when it is in use. However, you can do some evaluation by comparing your design
            against reference architectures or generic architectural patterns. Bosch’s (2000)
            description of the non-functional characteristics of architectural patterns can also be
            used to help with architectural evaluation.</p>
